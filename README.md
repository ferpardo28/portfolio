# Portfolio – Data Science

Welcome to my personal portfolio. This repository showcases a curated selection of projects I’ve developed during my Master’s in Applied Artificial Intelligence at Tecnológico de Monterrey, as well as from self-guided study.

Each project has been carefully reviewed and updated to follow best practices in data science and machine learning.
