# Portfolio – Data Science & Development

Welcome to my personal portfolio. This repository showcases a selection of projects I’ve worked on during my AI master's degree, as well as from self-guided courses and personal study.

## 🗂️ Structure

This portfolio is divided into two main folders:

- `data/` – Projects related to data science, NLP, machine learning, and analytics.
- `dev/` – Scripts and tools focused on general software development and backend logic.
